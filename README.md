# Clipack App
Micro Clipboard Package Manager

## Want to know
- One shortcut (Toggle App) -> CommandOrControl+Alt+h (Maybe hard to use for mac users)
- Listens and stashes all clipboard activity. -> Only text and html formats
- Two mode active. Pause copy listener and dont sleep my computer (experimental)

## Run The App
Look at the package.json -> scripts list. Run the scripts and then go to dist folder. All packages are there.
``` npm run package-win ```
``` npm run package-mac ```
